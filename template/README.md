Build Status Documentation Maintenance License: MIT

Clean and minimalist React Native template for a quick start with TypeScript.

⭐ Features Elegant usage directly within the React Native CLI Consistent with the default React Native template Minimal additional dependencies

See the below table to find out which version of the template to use.

⚠️ React Native CLI This template only works with the new CLI. Make sure you have uninstalled the legacy react-native-cli first (npm uninstall -g react-native-cli) for the below command to work. If you wish to not use npx, you can also install the new CLI globally (npm i -g @react-native-community/cli or yarn global add @react-native-community/cli).

If you tried the above and still get the react-native-template-react- native-template-typescript: Not found error, please try adding the --ignore-existing flag to force npx to ignore any locally installed versions of the CLI and use the latest.
